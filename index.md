## Course Overview

This course covers the core architectures and training methods used in contemporary deep learning. Topics include transformers, vision, diffusion, multimodal models (VLM), deep reinforcement learning, mechanistic interpretability and cutting-edge research in areas such as speech and video generation, RAG, MCP and agents, and scientific paper writing. Students will read and critically discuss the seminal papers across deep learning and contribute to that literature.

## Course Structure

Two lectures per week (mandatory attendance), weekly homework (pytorch and paper critiques), two midterms, and a group final project.

## Prerequisites

- Graduate machine learning: CIS5190, CIS5200 or equivalent

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Attendance | 10% |
| Homework | 20% |
| Paper Critiques | 20% |
| Final Project | 30% |
| Midterms | 20% |

## Major Course Themes

- **Attention and Transformers**: The backbone of modern deep learning
- **Vision and Segmentation**: YOLO, U-Net, SAM, diffusion models
- **Multimodal Learning**: CLIP, ViLBERT, cross-modal representations
- **Fine-tuning and Transfer**: LoRA, adapters, efficient adaptation
- **RAG, MCP, and Agentic AI**: Tool use, external memory, Toolformer
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization (DPO, PPO), Q-learning
- **Game-Playing AI**: AlphaGo/Zero, decision transformers
- **MoE and Distillation**: Sparse models, knowledge transfer
- **Audio/Video**: Conformers, Sora, speech models
- **Interpretability and Steering**: Gradient methods, probes, steering

Recurring questions will include: "Why this architecture and loss function?", "How was the training data collected, cleaned and augmented?", "What are the contributions of pretraining and fine tuning/post training?", "What is internal to the network; what external; why?", "How does this scale?"
